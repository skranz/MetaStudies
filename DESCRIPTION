Description: 
      This package mainly consists of Maximilan Kasy's code
      of his shiny app for MetaStudies
      on publication bias.
      I added some stuff, rewrote it a bit and
      put everything into an R package.
      The original code is here: 
      https://github.com/maxkasy/MetaStudiesApp
      The code is based on Andrews and Kasy (2019).
      In particular I added coded to run misspecification tests 
      that will be explained in Kranz and Pütz (2021).
