# MetaStudy

This package mainly consists of Maximilan Kasy's code
of his shiny app for MetaStudies
on publication bias.

The original code is here: 

https://github.com/maxkasy/MetaStudiesApp

The code is based on [Andrews and Kasy (2019)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180310).


I added some stuff, rewrote the interfaces a bit and
put everything into an R package.

In particular I added coded to run misspecification tests 
that will be explained in Kranz and Pütz (2021).
